      <h2>Animals</h2>
      <p>I love a lot of animals, especially animals underrepresented or badly represented in media. Many of these animals are in the family Mustelids, which most notably consists of weasles. The family also contains my favorite animal, the <strong>Russian Sable.</strong></p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>I've been playing Trombone since I was 11, and was good enough at brass instruments to be contracted to march in a professional marching band in 2019 & 2020. In my free time I almost always have music playing, and my love has never seemed to swindle.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/195762-drum-corps-international-the-athletes-who-bridge-art-and-sport">
        <p>But the beauty of the activity is not so much in the system in which is it executed, but in the process by which champions become champions through the power of music and performance.</p>
        <p>- Kasey Wahl, on <i>Drum Corps International</i>, the competition I marched in.</p>

      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>As a software engineer, I love coding a lot. Being able to engineer a solution that benefits your life is really satisfying and has helped me automate many repetitive tasks in my life,  saving me a lot of time.</p>

      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>Video games have been a huge part of my life, they're a great time waster!. I've also taken a couple courses on video game development so I can be able to create my own games.</p>

      <h2>Comedy</h2>
      <p>I watch a lot of comedy shows online, and always try to go to one whenever I'm in vegas. I enjoy dumb wit and comedy shows are usually full of it which is perfect.</p>
