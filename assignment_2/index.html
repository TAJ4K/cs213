        <h2>Animals</h2>
        <p>
          I love a lot of animals, especially animals underrepresented or badly
          represented in media. Many of these animals are in the family
          Mustelids, which most notably consists of weasles. The family also
          contains my favorite animal, the <strong>Russian Sable.</strong>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
          I've been playing Trombone since I was 11, and was good enough at
          brass instruments to be contracted to march in a professional marching
          band in 2019 & 2020. In my free time I almost always have music
          playing, and my love has never seemed to swindle.

            But the beauty of the activity is not so much in the system in which
            is it executed, but in the process by which champions become
            champions through the power of music and performance.

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I love coding a lot. Being able to engineer a
          solution that benefits your life is really satisfying and has helped
          me automate many repetitive tasks in my life, saving me a lot of time.

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>
          Video games have been a huge part of my life, they're a great time
          waster!. I've also taken a couple courses on video game development so
          I can be able to create my own games.

        <h2>Comedy</h2>
        <p>
          I watch a lot of comedy shows online, and always try to go to one
          whenever I'm in vegas. I enjoy dumb wit and comedy shows are usually
          full of it which is perfect.
